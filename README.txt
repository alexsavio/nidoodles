nidoodles
=========

*nidoodles* is a repository for toy code and documentation related to the nipy
projects.  We've used it particularly for thinking about UIs and visualization.
We hope it will lay the foundations for future robust code that we will
distribute and rely on.

Keep in mind when developing in this repository and relying on it that it will
change and break.
