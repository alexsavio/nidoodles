Nipy UI: user interface and visualization for neuroimaging in Python
=====================================================================

The purpose of this document is to collect information from the nipy
community regarding their visualization needs and desires.  There
exist several visualization tools for brain imaging, each excels at
some functionality but also has limitations.  We would like to
document the pros/cons of these applications and do our best to
combine the most useful functionality in our visualization tools.

Please feel free to add information on your favorite (or least
favorite) visualization tool.
