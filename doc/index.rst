Nipy UI: user interface and visualization for neuroimaging in Python
=====================================================================

The purpose of this document is to collect information from the nipy
community regarding their visualization needs and desires.  

There are many visualization tools for brain imaging, with different
strengths and weaknesses.  

We would like to document the pros/cons of these applications and do our
best to combine the most useful functionality in our visualization
tools.

Please feel free to add information on your favorite (or least
favorite) visualization tool.

If you know any visualization tools, please have a look at
:ref:`viz-tools` and consider filling in the features you like from your
favorite viewer. 

If you have a feature you think is important, please consider editing
the :ref:`feature-table` and adding the feature you think is important.

To edit these docs, please download by::

   bzr branch lp:~nipy-developers/nipy/nipy-ui

edit the documents in the ``doc`` subdirectory, then pushing the branch
back to Launchpad, or sending a patch.
