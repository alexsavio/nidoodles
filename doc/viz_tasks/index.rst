----------------
- Multiple planar views.

  - Orthogonal slice viewer three views, axial, sagittal, coronal of
    same brain (SPM like).

- Yoked or not

3D visualization
----------------
- Cut planes
- Cortical surfaces
- Tractography
- Anatomical connectivity
- ECoG
- 3D/2D yoking
- Activation isosurfaces

ROI Drawing
-----------
- Drawing
- Picking
- Masking

Light box (mosaic) views
------------------------
- Image overlay
- Time series animations
- Maximum intensity projection
- Yoke images with plots

- Profile view, 1D intensity plot of a picked image scan-line
