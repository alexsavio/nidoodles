=============================
 Current Visualization Tools
=============================

The purpose of this document is to record the current visualization
tools that people are using and list the best features of those
tools so that we may replicate or improve upon them in our tools.

See :ref:`review_template` for the template we are following for
reviewing the visualization tools.

If you'd like to add a new tool to these docs, please copy the
``review_template.rst`` file to a new name in this directory (such as
``funkyview.rst``), edit that file, and add (e.g.) ``funkyview`` to the
list below.

Please put images in (from this directory) ``../images``.

Don't forget to add any files to version control before committing with
``bzr add ../image/funkyview_viewing.png`` or similar.
